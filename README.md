# Go (programming language)
Go (often referred to as golang) is a programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source. (Wiki) <br />

## The major differences between Java and Golang are:

01. Go’s compilation speed is very fast as no VM is needed to execute Go program. <br />
02. Go can return more than one value whereas Java can’t. Every time you need to create object as there is no pointer support in Java.<br />
03. Garbage collection is pretty good in Golang. <br />
04. Golang have goroutine in order to achieve multitasking. <br /> 
05. A single thread in java takes more than 1 MB memory on heap whereas goroutine takes approx. 2 KB. <br /> 
06. You need to extend class from Thread class or implements Runnable interface and need to put your logic in run() in java , but in Golang you just need to write go keyword before function definition so it will make that function as goroutine. <br />
07. Also synchronization support is very good in golang. <br />
08. Go’s interface is more flexible as there is no support for inheritance. Inheritance makes things more complex in bigger projects. <br />
